- Retro 90s styling with neon headings and VHS/scanline effect.
- Sections to edit: About, Timeline, Gallery, Favorites, Guestbook.
- Guestbook messages are stored in `localStorage` and can be exported.
- Upload an audio file to play a 90s track locally.
- Toggle VHS effect and run confetti (the site auto-runs confetti on the birthday date).

Files:
- `index.html` — main page
- `styles.css` — styles
- `script.js` — interactivity
- `assets/` — vector placeholders

Customization:
- Edit text directly in the page (many fields are `contenteditable` or have inputs).
- Replace `assets/*.svg` with real photos.
